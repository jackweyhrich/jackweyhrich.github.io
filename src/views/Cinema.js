      <p>
        For the last several years, I&apos;ve had the idea to keep a log of all
        the new movies I watch. This year, 2025, I&apos;d like to make good on
        that idea. I&apos;ll only keep track of the movies that I haven&apos;t
        seen before, but I&apos;m hoping to continue my resolution from 2024 to
        focus on watching new movies rather than rewatching ones I&apos;ve seen
        before. I may still include some of re-watched films here, but I
        won&apos;t prioritize them.

        I saw this movie in theaters with my girlfriend and friends - it was a
        horror film that ended up having some pretty funny moments. With his
        frankly ridiculous mustache, the Count Orlok character looked a lot like
        Jim Carrey&apos;s Eggman from Sonic the Hedgehog (whose{" "}

        is coincidentally in theaters this same month). The dissatisfying
        ending, otherwise predictable plot and flat characters left me
        unimpressed with the film, but I had fun and enjoyed lots of laughs with
        my friends throughout the experience.
